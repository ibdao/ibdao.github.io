            My name is Ian Dao. I am an aspiring full-stack software engineer. <br> 
            Out of college, I started pursuing healthcare professions but became frustrated with the business side of the industry. <br>
            I found my new passion for coding as I find it fun and enjoy the problem solving challenges. <br> 
            I would like to find ways to serve my community through web development and proficient UX/UI design. <br>
            In my free time, I spend time finding ways to exercise through hiking, walking and Ultimate Frisbee. <br>
            If you want to know more about my professional career, you can view my resume <a href="Dao_Ian_Resume 2021 Updated.pdf">here!</a>
